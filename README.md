# Complex Social Systems Fall 2020 – Research Plan

> * Group Name: The Traffic Team
> * Group participants names: Diego De los Santos, Daniel Nezamabadi, Natalie Suter, Róbert Veres, Victor Vitéz
> * Project Title: Effects of a general speed limit on multi-lane highway throughput

## General Introduction

(Why is it important/interesting to solve this problem?)
- Highways are an important part of our infrastructure, which are used by a lot of people every day for different reasons: To commute to work, transport goods and to go on holidays. Thus a general speed limit may have significant consequences for many people. In particular, we want to analyze the effects of a general speed limit on the throughput of multi-lane highways.
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)
- Many (European) countries have a general speed limit in place
- Germany one of few countries that doesn't have such a limit and where controversial debates surrounding a general speed limit happen regularly
	- First article in 1975 (Zeit) "Der alte Streit ist neu entflammt: Tempostopp auf Autobahnen - ja oder nein?", more recently in 2019 (Andreas Scheuer (German Verkehrsminister) gegen neue Tempolimit-Debatte)


## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

- How does a general speed limit affect highway throughput?
- How does the effect of a general speed limit on highway throughput change with varying proportions and types of drivers?
- What happens to the highway throughput if drivers are forced to change their speed? (Obstacles, construction sites)
- Is there a difference in response to "forced" speed changes (obstacles, construction site) with and without a general speed limit? If yes, what are those differences?

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

- We expect that a general speed limit decreases traffic congestion and thus increase highway throughput in basically all situations by decreasing differences in speed of individual cars.

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)
